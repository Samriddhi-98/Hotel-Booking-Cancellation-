Problem Definition- The INN Hotels Group is facing a significant challenge due to the increasing rate of booking cancellations, resulting in inventory loss and revenue reduction. In the last three months, inventory loss due to cancellations reached 18%, contributing to approximately $0.25 million in annual revenue loss. The companyâ€™s current heuristic approaches (based on rules and domain expertise) have proven to be ineffective, neither scalable nor efficient in minimizing these losses. To address this, INN Hotels Group seeks a data-driven approach to predict booking cancellations more accurately and proactively.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of hotel bookings being canceled, which can help the hotel group reduce inventory loss, minimize revenue impact, and improve overall operational efficiency.


Key Features- 

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, transforming features, and addressing imbalanced classes.

Model Training: Using classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict cancellations.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure optimal performance.

Deployment Readiness: Steps to integrate the model into a production environment, including API creation for prediction.



Conclusion- 
This project provides a machine learning solution to predict the likelihood of hotel booking cancellations, addressing the challenge faced by the INN Hotels Group. By implementing this solution, the hotel group can reduce inventory loss, optimize revenue, and enhance operational efficiency.
