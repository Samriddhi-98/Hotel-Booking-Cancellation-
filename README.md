Problem Definition: The INN Hotels Group is facing a significant challenge due to the increasing rate of booking cancellations, resulting in inventory loss and revenue reduction. In the last three months, inventory loss due to cancellations reached 18%, contributing to approximately $0.25 million in annual revenue loss. The companyâ€™s current heuristic approaches (based on rules and domain expertise) have proven to be ineffective, neither scalable nor efficient in minimizing these losses. To address this, INN Hotels Group seeks a data-driven approach to predict booking cancellations more accurately and proactively.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of hotel bookings being canceled, which can help the hotel group reduce inventory loss, minimize revenue impact, and improve overall operational efficiency.
